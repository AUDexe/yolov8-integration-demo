# Hand Gesture Recognition

## Overview
This web application implements hand gesture recognition using the YOLOv8 neural network and JavaScript. It allows users to detect and classify hand gestures in real-time video streams from their webcam.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition
- Uses YOLOv8 neural network model
- Implemented in JavaScript for web browsers

## How it Works
For detailed information on how to live stream your webcam to an HTML page, refer to the tutorial [here](https://dev.to/dalalrohit/live-stream-your-webcam-to-html-page-3eh).

The application captures video frames from the user's webcam and processes them using the YOLOv8 model to detect hand gestures. Detected gestures are then classified and displayed in real-time.

For additional information on implementing object detection in videos using YOLOv8 and JavaScript, refer to the tutorials [here](https://dev.to/andreygermanov/how-to-detect-objects-in-videos-in-a-web-browser-using-yolov8-neural-network-and-javascript-lfb) and [here](https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/yolov4-custom-functions).

## Installation
No installation required. Simply open the web application in a modern web browser that supports webcam access.

## Usage
1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Grant access to your webcam when prompted.
3. Perform hand gestures in front of the webcam to see real-time recognition.

## Technologies Used
